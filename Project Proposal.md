##Flights Recommendation Model

#Overview / Introduction:
First of all, data science nowadays is becoming more important than ever. It the way to an artificial intelligence world while using machine learning techniques to automate, predict and solve problems. In this project, I will be using a recommendation algorithm that recommends solutions and improvements for companies or government sectors to support their decision-making process by discovering data patterns and analyze data to answer questions.

#Question / Need:
The General Authority of Civil Aviation is the main controller and issuer of all flights in Saudi Arabia. The main need is to have a recommendation system that recommend which airport needs to have more flights based how many passengers and the availability of seats, which suggest more seats that can occupy more passengers that increase revenue.
